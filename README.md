# clspv

**Clspv** is a prototype compiler for a subset of OpenCL C to Vulkan
compute shaders.

It consists of:
* A set of LLVM Module passes to transform a dialect of LLVM IR into
  a SPIR-V module containing Vulkan compute shaders.
* A command line compiler tool called _'clspv'_ to compile a subset of
  OpenCL C into a Vulkan compute shader.

Clspv depends on external projects:
* Top-of-tree versions of [Clang][Clang] and [LLVM][LLVM]
* [SPIRV-Tools][SPIRV-Tools]
* [SPIRV-Headers][SPIRV-Headers]

## Status

The compiler is an incomplete prototype, with many rough edges.

The input language is a subset of OpenCL C version 1.2.
The [OpenCL C on Vulkan Specification](docs/OpenCLCOnVulkan.md)
describes the specific subset, and also the mapping into Vulkan compute
shaders.

## Examples

Compile a set of kernels into a SPIR-V binary module:

    clspv foo.cl -o foo.spv

Emit the binary as a C initializer list, for easy embedding of a shader in
in a C or C++ program source:

    clspv -mfmt=c foo.cl -o -

Predefine some preprocessor symbols:

    clspv -DWIDTH=32 -DHEIGHT=64 foo.cl -o foo.spv

Use OpenCL compiler options:

    clspv -cl-fast-relaxed-math -cl-single-precision-constant foo.cl -o foo.spv

Show help:

    clspv -help

## Build

### Tools

You will need:

* CMake
* Python
* A C++ compiler
* git

### Getting sources for dependencies

Clspv depends on the sources for other projects, at specific commits.
Run the following command to download those dependencies, and place them
in the `third_party` directory:

    python utils/fetch_sources.py

### Building

Then, create a build directory:

    cd <clspv-dir>
    mkdir build
    cd build

Then configure and build the code:

    cmake <clspv-dir>
    cmake --build .

This will build the `clspv` command line compiler and place it in
location `bin/clspv` under the build directory.

### Using Ninja to build, and other build options

We recommend you use the [Ninja][Ninja] build tool if it's available.
To do so, replace the last two commands with:

    cmake -G Ninja <clspv-dir>
    ninja

Other useful configuration options (the first `cmake` command):

* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` : Build in release mode, with debugging
  information. Default is a debug build.

See the [CMake][CMake] [documentation][CMake-doc] for more generic options.

## Test

To run the test suite from within the build directory:

    cmake --build . --target check-spirv

Or if you are using Ninja:

    ninja check-spirv
